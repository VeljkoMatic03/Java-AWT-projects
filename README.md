Three Java AWT "games" used as homework for my university class.

In src directory are 3 packages for 3 apps, one being just a PacMan map designer, one being a sort of Ball vs Block game, and one being a "Vacuum Cleaner" game where user clicks the screen and red triangle just swoops those black dots.

These versions are just base for our lab assignment.
